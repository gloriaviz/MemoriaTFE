The evaluation of the relationship and its intensity between two or more random variables is an objective present in any statistical study. For this purpose, a wide range of statistical measures adapted to the nature of the variables analyzed have been proposed.  

The aim of this project is to compile measures of association between nominal variables, including their theoretical definition and statistical inference.    

Also, the report includes their implementation in R and/or the use of R libraries, with an illustration on real data. In addition, in order to illustrate their applicability, it includes references to recent scientific studies in which these measures have been used.
